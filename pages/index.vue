        Hello! My name is Bos Eriko and I'm a full-stack developer using
        JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. I like to make stuff every now and then.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-5 leading-loose">
        Besides making stupid things here and there I also like to play games
        and watch Anime. I can also speak Nihongo at a Shiba Inu level. It's a
        good thing to note that I'm a weeb so I decided to add a Ninja on the
        right side. Just for shitty reasons.
