A website for my creation

## Tools
- NextJS
- GitHub

## GitHub Integration
This project is using GitHub to showcase all my creations. It checks all the projects that I have with a topic of `portfolio` which are then sorted by last update. Then each project entry fetches `PORTFOLIO.md` as content of each project on the website.
