## GitHub Integration
This project is using GitHub to showcase all my creations. It checks all the projects that I have with a topic of `product` or `project` which are then sorted by last update. Then each project entry fetches `PORTFOLIO.md` as content of each project on the website.

## DEV Integration
Blogs are pulled from [dev.to](https://dev.to/boseriko).

## Resume Builder
Resume also pulls data from GitHub. Projects are pulled daily as well as the languages that I use. You can also download it as PDF.
