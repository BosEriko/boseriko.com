# FAQ
Some frequently asked questions.

### How do you add a repository on product or project page?
Repositories are automatically added to product or project page when `product` or `project` is added to the topics of a repository.

### Where does the content of a repository page come from?
It comes from **PORTFOLIO.md** on the root of a repository.

### Where does the cover photo of a repository page come from?
It comes from **COVER.png** on the root of a repository. If no **COVER.png** is found it will generate its own cover photo.

### What's the difference between a product repository and a project repository?
Product repositories are repositories that I work on constantly while project repositories are repositories that I work on every now and then.

### Where does the blogs come from?
It comes from **dev.to**.

### Where does Personal Projects on the Resume page come from?
It pulls my top 5 starred repositories with the `product` topic. A little confusing I know but it will be more weird if I add the word product on the resume page.

### Which topics are included in the pills?
It checks an array of topics [here](https://github.com/BosEriko/gh-data/blob/main/topics.json).
